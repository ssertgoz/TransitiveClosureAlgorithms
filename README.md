# TransitiveClosureAlgorithms

This project include three different reflexive transitive closure algorithms. 
First one is has n**(n+1) complexity and its not efficient. 
Second one is has n**5 complexity, its more efficient than first one. 
Third one is has n**3 complexity, so its the most efficient one. 

There are there function for theese algorithms in the code and you can 
enter the alphabet and relation set to functions to calculate closures
